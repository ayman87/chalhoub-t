    "The Middle East fashion sector has been growing rapidly. Over the past six decades, we succeeded in building fashion brands in the region by leveraging our strong knowledge of the market, of the consumers, and of the new trends. For us, it is essential to grasp our customers who are constantly evolving. Understanding the channels they use to get information on the products, the reasons they choose one brand over another, the way they spend, and their connection to labels in general, is crucial to better serve them. From ultimate luxury brands to aspirational and more affordable ones, we aim to develop brands in the region turning them into market leaders via one touch point. We have a team of experts continuously developing their knowledge and skills in each of the fashion categories we operate in: women, men, children, fashion accessories as well as footwear, lingerie and swimwear. This is reflected in the buying selection and forecasting and in the identification of the right brands whether in representation, distribution, or retail. Today, Fashion represents 34% of our activity. Some of our brands are Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Tory Burch, Lanvin, Swarovski and Lacoste.",
